# Python YouTube Downloader

---

This is a command line application that can be used to download individual videos as well as whole playlists as video or audio. The project is setup within a pyinstaller template, therefore you can make your own self contained executable if you do not want to use the one I compiled for macOS.

## Setup
---
This program depends on the pytube library. To install it run the following command:
```
pip install pytube
```

## Usage
---
Move to the root directory of the program then run
```
python3 cli.py
```

Downloads will be placed in a folder within your downloads folder.
